# Data structure
In this repo i only have 1 exercise which is a program to convert an infix to prefix using the stack data structure.
And some examples on how to use arrays in c#.

## Ararys
The declaration of an array in c# is the following:
```c#
string[] x; //Declaration of an array, but is not initialized
x = new []{"Leo","Johnny","Kieran"}; //Initialization of an array with 3 strings inside, so that is the size of the array.
```
You can use different methods for the array, such as: Length wich returns the size of the array.
```c#
Console.WriteLine(x.Length);
```

To access to the info inside of an array you should use a loop, in this case the most common is for loop
```c#
for(int i = 0 ; i < Length.size ; i++){
    Console.WriteLine(x[i]); //x[index] returns the object that is in that index/
}
```
## Stack class


## Main class
